This is my first post. I have finally decided and gathered the courage to write. I always wanted to write but dint had that inspiration but recently I got so much inspired from skilled writers like [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/), [Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/) ,[Vincent Warmerdam](https://calmcode.io/), [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/), [Daniel Seita](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/about.html), [Laszlo Sragner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlosragner/), [Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/) and [Sebastian Ruder](https://ruder.io/) to name a few and many more, that I wanted to start writing on my own. Let's see how it goes.
