# About Me

:wave: **Hi !**

{{< style "strong{color:#5500ff}" >}} I am **Smit Zaveri**. I am currently working as _Senior Product Data Scientist_ in Hitachi Vantara.{{< /style >}}  
I have expertise in developing ML pipelines and deployment ready frameworks.I like to own the whole process from documentation/ideation of business problem to delivery of ML product.This includes all of the steps including not-very-ml-like-tasks (if necessary) such as data sysnthesis, data collection, automation, infrastructure, controlled experiment designing etc. I love to follow and read about MLOps and ML System Design and I actively participate in MLOps events. 

Prior to industrial experience I have worked on experimental physics and computational physics research.

>I am very strict with my routine and always start my day by working out. I am fitness freak. In my free time I play DOTA 2 as well. I love to read and write about different things. I am a firm believer that a heavy workout gives you healthy mind and that brings healthy lifestyle.

### Work Experience 

:briefcase: In my current role I am working on different problems in Cloud Domain. Currently I am working on **ChatBot service to support SREs** to enable faster resolution of tickets/incidents/issues in the system. Previously, I have worked on **Anomaly Detection Problem in microservice architecture** and also worked on **Root Cause Analysis for the anomalies in micro-service architecture**. Both of these models are UAT tested and are sold to clients. For the solution I have worked on for Root Cause Analysis we have filed **patent**.

:briefcase: Before this I have worked as _Machine Learning Engineer_ in Hitachi Vantara, where I have worked on implementing different research papers to analyse Logs Data and worked on big data computing.

:briefcase: I have worked as Machine Learning Intern in Hitachi Vantara prior to this where I learnt basics of log analysis, big data computing, basics of NLP, log parsing and frequecy based predictions.

:briefcase: I have worked on different platforms like AWS & Azure. I have worked on data synthesis, controlled experimentation using Chaos Mesh for micro-service environment and so on.
